This project includes a Flask server that enables an Anime Discord Rich Presence display. 

To start the server either the `DCM-flask-server.exe` or `DCM-flask-server` must be started under Linux or alternatively the `DCM-flask-server.py` file must be executed via Python.

Since the server runs on port 8000 by default, this port should be free, otherwise the server cannot be started.

Once the server has started without errors, you can configure the RPC under ![localhost:8000](localhost:8000) and start and stop it.

With the ![Firefox-Addon ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/anime-discord-rpc1/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) you can get an automatic start and stop of the RPC when looking at the supported websites, as well as a manual setting via the popup menu of the addon.

Currently supported websites are:
- Crunchyroll
- AniWorld (Use at own risk)
